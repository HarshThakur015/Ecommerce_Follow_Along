# Ecommerce Follow-Along  

### **Milestone 1: Project Overview**  
In today's live session, our mentor introduced us to the MERN Stack structure. We learned the foundational steps to set up the development environment for upcoming milestones. Additionally, we created a new repository for our follow-along project.  

### **Milestone 2: Development Setup & Login Page**  

- **Project Folder Structure:** Organized project files into separate frontend and backend directories.  
- **React Frontend Setup:** Initialized a React application to build the user interface.  
- **Node.js Backend Setup:** Set up a basic Node.js server in preparation for API integration in future milestones.  
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Integrated and configured Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive, utility-based styling.  
- **Login Page Development:** Designed and implemented the first user interface for the e-commerce application, ensuring both functionality and styling.  


### **Milestone 3: Backend Setup & Database Connection**  

In this mentor-led live session, we focused on:  
- Structuring backend folders and files efficiently.  
- Configuring and connecting the Node.js server to MongoDB.  
- Implementing basic error-handling mechanisms.  


### **Milestone 4: User Model & File Upload Configuration**  

During this session, we:  
- Created a **User Model**â€”a blueprint for storing user data in the database.  
- Developed a **User Controller** to manage user-related operations (such as adding a new user or retrieving user details).  
- Integrated and configured **Multer**, allowing the application to handle and store file uploads (e.g., user profile images).  
- Finally, we pushed all the changes to our repository.

### **Milestone 5: Sign-Up Page & Form Validation**  

In this milestone, weâ€™ll build the **Sign-Up Page** and set up routes for user registration.  

 **Learning Goals**
- Develop a user-friendly **Sign-Up Page** (Name, Email, Password).  
- Implement **form validation** for proper input formatting.  
- Update the **README** to document progress.  

  **Key Concepts**  
- **Sign-Up Page:** Allows users to create an account by entering their details.  
- **Form Validation:** Ensures correct input formats (e.g., valid email, secure password).

  **Steps**  
- Design the **Sign-Up Page** using HTML & CSS.  
- Add validation to prevent incorrect inputs.  

# Milestone 6: Secure Signup Backend 

 **Learning Goals**  
- Encrypt passwords using bcrypt before storing them.  
- Securely save user data in the database.  

  **Why Encrypt Passwords?**   
- Protects user data and ensures privacy.  
- Prevents password theft and ensures compliance (GDPR, PCI-DSS).  

  **Implementation Steps**  
1. **Encrypt Passwords**: Hash passwords using bcrypt before saving.  
2. **Store User Data**: Save user details securely with encrypted passwords.   

Hereâ€™s a concise version of your content, formatted for a README file:

# Milestone 7: User Login Backend ðŸš€  

 **Learning Goals**  
- Validate user credentials during login.  
- Compare encrypted passwords securely.  

 **Why Encrypt Passwords?** 
- **Security**: Protects user data if the database is compromised.  
- **Privacy**: Prevents storing passwords in plain text.  
- **Compliance**: Meets security standards (GDPR, PCI-DSS).  
- **Prevention**: Makes password theft harder with hashing.  

 **How Login Authentication Works**  
1. **User Inputs Credentials** â†’ Email/username & password.  
2. **Fetch User Data** â†’ Check if the user exists in the database.  
3. **Validate Password** â†’ Use bcrypt to hash & compare with stored hash.  

   **Steps to Implement**  
1. **Create Login Endpoint** â†’ Accept email/username & password.  
2. **Retrieve User** â†’ Fetch user data from the database.  
3. **Verify Password** â†’ Hash input & compare with stored hash.  

 **Note:** Passwords are hashed (not decrypted). We compare hashes for authentication.
