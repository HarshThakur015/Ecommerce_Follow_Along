# Ecommerce Follow-Along  

### **Milestone 1: Project Overview**  
In today's live session, our mentor introduced us to the MERN Stack structure. We learned the foundational steps to set up the development environment for upcoming milestones. Additionally, we created a new repository for our follow-along project.  

### **Milestone 2: Development Setup & Login Page**  

- **Project Folder Structure:** Organized project files into separate frontend and backend directories.  
- **React Frontend Setup:** Initialized a React application to build the user interface.  
- **Node.js Backend Setup:** Set up a basic Node.js server in preparation for API integration in future milestones.  
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Integrated and configured Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive, utility-based styling.  
- **Login Page Development:** Designed and implemented the first user interface for the e-commerce application, ensuring both functionality and styling.  


### **Milestone 3: Backend Setup & Database Connection**  

In this mentor-led live session, we focused on:  
- Structuring backend folders and files efficiently.  
- Configuring and connecting the Node.js server to MongoDB.  
- Implementing basic error-handling mechanisms.  


### **Milestone 4: User Model & File Upload Configuration**  

During this session, we:  
- Created a **User Model**â€”a blueprint for storing user data in the database.  
- Developed a **User Controller** to manage user-related operations (such as adding a new user or retrieving user details).  
- Integrated and configured **Multer**, allowing the application to handle and store file uploads (e.g., user profile images).  
- Finally, we pushed all the changes to our repository.
